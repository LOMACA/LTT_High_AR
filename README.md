This program computes aerodynamic data using the Lifting Linear Theory as well as a Non-Linear Numerical Lifting Line Model. 


User manual:

Initialize the model by running the code in any Python environment and a GUI for the necessary inputs will appear. Input the wing geometry and initial aerodynamic parameters as well as your desired source for the airfoil data. In the latter you can distinguish between XFoil or Windtunnel data as source, making sure that in the path you give as working directory you have two folders called "XFoil" and "Windtunnel" which contain files with aerodynamic coefficients in the output format of XFoil, as shown below.
